What are `STDIN`, `STDOUT` and `STDERR`?

Ans ~ STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR are three standard streams in Unix-like operating systems.

STDIN (standard input) is a stream of data that is read by a program.
It is typically used to read input from the user, such as through the keyboard or a file.

STDOUT (standard output) is a stream of data that is written by a program.
 It is typically used to write output to the user, such as on the screen or a file.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STDERR (standard error) is a stream of data that is used to write error messages from a program.
 It is typically used to write error messages to the user, such as on the screen or a file.

functions to read and write data to and from a program.
