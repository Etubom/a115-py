 1) We mentioned “unit tests”, which are used to test individual low-level code units such as functions and methods.
    We also mentioned higher-level “functional tests”, which are automated ways of testing the functionality of an entire system.
    What other kinds of test suites can you learn about? For example, what are “integration tests”?
    What are “non-functional tests”?
 Ans ~ Integration tests: Integration tests are designed to verify that the different components or modules of a system work together correctly when integrated.
       They ensure that the interactions between different parts of the software function as expected.
       Integration testing can be performed at various levels, such as testing the integration between modules, services, or even external systems.

 2) What is “regression” and “regression testing”?
 Ans ~ "Regression testing" is the process of running tests on a modified or updated software system to identify any regression defects.
       The purpose of regression testing is to ensure that changes made to the application have not introduced any unintended side effects or caused regression issues that impact previously functioning features.

 3) What are “behaviour tests” (BDD)? What is “gherkin syntax”?How does that work in Python?
 Ans ~ "Behaviour tests" or "Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)" is a software development methodology that focuses on collaboration and communication between developers, testers, and business stakeholders.
        BDD aims to align technical requirements and business objectives by using a common language that all stakeholders can understand.

        Gherkin is a human-readable, domain-specific language used to describe the behavior of a system in a structured format. It uses a set of keywords and syntax to define the features, scenarios, and steps involved.

        E.G:
            Feature: Login functionality
                      As a user
                      I want to be able to login to the systems

        In Python, there are several BDD frameworks that support Gherkin syntax and facilitate behavior testing, such as Behave, Lettuce, and PyTest-BDD.
        These frameworks allow you to write automated tests using Gherkin syntax and execute them using Python.

 4) What is “test driven development” (TDD)?
 ns ~ Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code.
