1) What are the various operation that can be performed on lists(and their elements)?
Ans :
     - You can add two list lists together using '+' or add an item using the append() method.This mutates
     - One can use len() method to get the length/size of a list passed as an argument
     - One can use the remove() method to remove a list item by passing the value to be removed as an argument.It mutates.
     - One can use the count() method to return the number of times a value passed as an argument can be found
     - The list sort() method sorts numbers in ascending order and strings in alphabetical format
     - The list slice() method returns a new list with sliced items
     - list sorted() does same aaction as sort() but returns a new list instead of mutating original
     - The insert() method adds an element to a specific index in the list
     - The list pop() method removes and returns a list item.It takes an optional input which is the index of item to be removed

2) How does list slicing work in python?What are the different  things you can do with slicing?
   (EXTRA CREDIT: can you figure out how to get all the elements of a list in reverse order just by using slicing notation)
Ans  :
      - The slice() method used on list doesn't mutate the original list, it returns a new copy
      -  Using slice returns a slice or sub-list of list elements.
         It's created using a subscript notation [] with colons
         eg variable_name[1:2:3] where 1 = start(included in our slice), 2 = stop(excluded in our slice) and 3 = step(optional args for difference between each index in sequence)
      -  my_list[::-1] returns a new list with items reversed

3)  How do you check "list membership" in python?In other words, if I have a list of fruits, what
     is the simplest way to check whether there is an 'apple' in the list?
Ans   :
       -  By using the "in" keyword
          fruits=["apple","mangoe","orange"]
          print("apple" in fruits) //True
