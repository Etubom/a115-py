2) What are OpenAPI and Swagger?
Ans ~ OpenAPI is a specification for describing RESTful APIs. It is a standardized way of describing an API, which makes it easier for developers to understand and interact with it.
    Swagger is a set of tools that can be used to create, document, and consume RESTful APIs.
    It includes a web-based editor that can be used to create OpenAPI specifications,
    as well as a Swagger UI that can be used to visualize and interact with an API.

3) How can you write unit tests for your code which accesses
external APIs, without actually hitting any API endpoints while
running your tests?
Ans ~ Use a mock library. A mock library is a tool that allows you to create fake objects that mimic the behavior of real objects.
      For example, you can use a mock library to create a fake API endpoint that returns a canned response.
      This allows you to write unit tests for your code without actually hitting the real API endpoint.

4) Enterprise APIs, private APIs which require a paid subscription for
  access, and even many public APIs usually can not be accessed directly, in the way we did above. They typically require some form of authentication.
  What is "token-based" authentication? What is "BASIC AUTH"? What is OAuth? How can the `requests` library be used to authenticate via these schemes?

 Ans ~
        Token-based authentication: Token-based authentication is a type of authentication where a client is issued a token that can be used to access the API. The token is typically a short string of characters that is generated by the API server. The client then sends the token with each request to the API server.
        The API server then validates the token and grants access to the API if the token is valid.
        ----------------------------
        import requests

        # API endpoint URL
        url = "https://api.example.com/data"

        # Token
        token = "your_token_here"

        # Headers with Authorization token
        headers = {
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {token}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }

        # Send GET request
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

        # Print the response
        print(response.json())
        ----------------------------------

        Basic authentication: Basic authentication is a simple type of authentication where the client sends their username and password in clear text with each request to the API.
        The API server then validates the username and password and grants access to the API if the username and password are valid.
        -----------------------------------
        import requests

        # API endpoint URL
        url = "https://api.example.com/data"

        # Credentials
        username = "your_username"
        password = "your_password"

        # Headers with Basic Authentication
        headers = {
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }

        # Send GET request with Basic Authentication
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, auth=(username, password))

        # Print the response
        print(response.json())

---------------------------------------------
        OAuth: OAuth is a more complex type of authentication that allows third-party applications to access an API on behalf of a user.
        OAuth works by exchanging an authorization code for an access token. The authorization code is obtained by the third-party application from the user.
        The access token is then used by the third-party application to access the API on behalf of the user.
        ----------------------------
        import requests_oauthlib

        # OAuth 2.0 credentials
        client_id = "your_client_id"
        client_secret = "your_client_secret"
        authorization_url = "https://api.example.com/oauth/authorize"
        token_url = "https://api.example.com/oauth/token"
        redirect_uri = "https://your-app.com/callback"

        # Create an OAuth2Session
        oauth_session = requests_oauthlib.OAuth2Session(client_id, redirect_uri=redirect_uri)

        # Fetch the authorization URL
        authorization_url, state = oauth_session.authorization_url(authorization_url)

        # User authorization (manual step)
        print("Please authorize the application by visiting the following URL:")
        print(authorization_url)

        # Get the authorization code (manual step)
        authorization_code = input("Enter the authorization code: ")

        # Fetch the access token using the authorization code
        token = oauth_session.fetch_token(
            token_url,
            authorization_response=authorization_code,
            client_secret=client_secret
        )

        # API endpoint URL
        url = "https://api.example.com/data"

        # Send GET request with OAuth 2.0 token
        response = oauth_session.get(url)

        # Print the response
        print(response.json())
