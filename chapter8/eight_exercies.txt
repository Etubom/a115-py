1. What is “PEP8”?
Ans ~ "PEP8" stands for Python Enhancement Proposal 8.
It is a style guide for Python code that provides recommendations on how to write code that is easy to read and maintain.
PEP8 covers topics such as code layout, whitespace, comments, naming conventions, and programming practices.

2. What is a “linter”?
Ans ~ A "linter" is a tool that analyzes source code to detect and report errors, potential issues, and style violations.
It checks the code against a set of predefined rules or style guidelines and provides feedback to the developer to
 improve the code's quality, readability, and maintainability.

3. What are some popular Python linters?
Ans ~ Some popular Python linters include:
PyLint: checks for errors, style issues, and common programming mistakes
Flake8: combines PyFlakes, pycodestyle, and McCabe into a single tool for checking syntax, style, and complexity
Black: not only checks code style but also automatically formats the code to conform to PEP8

4. What is a “code formatter”? Research the Python tool `black`
Ans ~ A "code formatter" is a tool that automatically reformats source code to adhere to a predefined
style guide or set of rules. It helps developers save time and effort by automatically fixing
style and formatting issues, making code consistent, and reducing the chance of introducing
errors. "Black" is a Python code formatter that automatically reformats the code to conform
to PEP8 style guide. It uses a set of heuristics to format the code, such as
line length, blank lines, import sorting, and string quotes.

5. Try to run one or two of these tools on some (or all!) of the code
you have written so far. See what you can make of their output.
