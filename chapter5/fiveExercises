1. What’s a built-in Python function to add up the values of all the numbers in a list?
   What’s a built-in Python function to find the smallest number in a list? How about the largest?

Ans ~ sum(),min(),max()

2. What do the functions `any()` and `all()` do in Python?

Ans ~ They are both python in-built functions that operate on iterables like lists,tuples and sets.
       The any() function returns true because atleast one element in the iterable is true while
       the all() function only returns true if "All" iterable elements are true but false if only
       one is false.
3. Write a function which takes a list of numbers and returns the
   sum of their squares. Does your function still work if the input list is empty?
   Why (or why not?).
Ans ~   numbers = [1,2,3]
        def sum_of_squares(numbers):
            return sum([x**2 for x in numbers])
        print(sum_of_squares(numbers))
      The function still works if the list is empty because it's sum will be zero
4. Write a function called `apply()` which takes two arguments:
    a. A list of `items`;
    b. Another function `f`, which takes a single value and returns a single value;
    Your function should return a list in which each value is the result of applying
    the function `f` on the corresponding value in `items`.
